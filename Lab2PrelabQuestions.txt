- What is assembly language

Assembly is the legible programming language representation of computer instructions.

– In the assembly code sub a,b,c, which operand is the destination?

a = b - c (a is the destination)

– Why are operands stored in registers?

Operands are stored in registers because the instructions need to be able to access their operands quickly for fast computation.

– This lab creates 8 registers. How many registers does a MIPs have?

32

– How many operands can be read from a MIPs register at a time?

2

– How many operands can be written to a MIPs register at a time?

1

– In your own words describe the distinction between machine language & assembly language.

Machine language is the binary code which assembly language compiles down to. Machine language is illegible to human
while assembly is meant to be the legible representation of machine code where each instruction corisponds directly
to a machine code instruction.

– how many bits are typically 1 register.

32 bits for standard MIPs registers, but 64 bit registers do exist for the 64 bit version of MIPs
